        <h1>React Hooks</h1>

        <h3>
            In today's homework you'll apply your new skills on the Strivebooks
            project, converting every Class Component into a Functional one with Hooks!
        </h3>
        <p>
            Start from your existing Strivebooks project.
            If you want to start fresh with a clean slate, you can
            clone this repo to get started:
            https://github.com/irvelervel/m4-d6-hw
        </p>

        <h2>HINTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use useState() and useEffect() to mimic Class Component capabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember that useEffect() can be used like componentDidMount
                as well as componentDidUpdate, depending on what you put on
                its dependency array.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try to mantain the values for the input fields in AddComment
                in a single object, using just one useState() for the whole form.
            </li>
        </ul>
